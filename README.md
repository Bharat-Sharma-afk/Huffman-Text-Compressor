# Huffman-Text-Compressor
A utf-8 Text Document Compressor

Huffman Text Compressor is a Console based application to Compress utf-8 encoded text files and generate a Compressed File Smaller in Size.
Huffman code is a particular type of optimal prefix code on the basis of frequency distribution of different characters, that is commonly used for lossless data compression.
This Application uses those Huffman codes for the Text based on frquency distribution and has a Compression rate of as good as Double for larger files.

Instructions to Run:

For Compressing Text file:
1. Run Compressor.py in terminal by typing "python Compressor.py".
2. Enter the name of Text File to be Compressed.
3. A new File with extension(.cmp) is generated, this is your Compressed file.

Note: The file will lose any data which is not in utf-8 format during the Compression and Decompression.

For Decompressing Text file:
1. Run Decompressor.py in terminal by typing "python Decompressor.py".
2. Enter the name of File to be Decompressed, it must have a (.cmp) extension.
3. A new File with the same name as the input file is generated, this is your Decompressed file.


Note: The file will lose any data which is not in utf-8 format during the Compression and Decompression.

Happy Coding!!!
